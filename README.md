# FPath-Linux-Win
Easy work with Fstream, filesystem etc.pathes on all platforms.

## About
Fast find your files at bash or you can use lib in c++ project( for fstream or filesystem)
`FPath.lib` `FPath.h`(try find this files use, after install repositry) 

## For what
Programm make smart analysis for find all path to some file, now you must'nt write and remind full pathes in your projects

##Install

```console
git clone https://github.com/ArtemBystrovOfficial/FPath-Linux-WIn ./FPath
sudo ln -s $PWD/FPath/build/bin/fpath /usr/bin
```

##How use
use command in bash
fpath [FLAG] ROOT_PATH FILE_SEARCHED ARGUMENTS...
- FLAG -s -> if you must use accurate way you can put in arguments directiories before file 
  - Example : fpath -s /home/artem main.cpp Project_x Debug 
  - Output  : /home/artem/Desktop/repos/Projcet_x/Debug/main.cpp
- You must use Arguments when file not only one in search space, if programm find too or you make doesn't true arguments, she said that
- Without flag -s Arguments work with any directiores on way. if this directory or some directory unique for situation, programm return path to file

### You can help for developed this kit, and add some smart functions
